### Study Abstract
The Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was highly transmissible and caused unprecedented infections in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). It is extremely challenging to know the burden of Omicron due to various factors (eg. limited testing capacity, changing testing eligibility and non-pharmaceutical interventions (Nl Alert level System)). The efficacy of the Alert Level System (ALS) implemented in limiting or controlling the spread of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in NL is not known. This study considers seroprevalence data to estimate true cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence by identifying antibodies that indicate infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  From these seroprevalence data we infer daily incidence (December 15, 2021 to  May 26, 2022) and calibrate a mechanistic compartmental model to these seroprevalence data to estimate the effective reproduction number for different levels of alert level system. Given the testing eligibility criteria, we calculate the eligible fraction of the NL population. We combine these eligibility fraction estimates with the seroprevalence data to independently predict the number of reported cases. We estimate that the net reproduction number was $R_t = ?$ when the most restrictive combination of NPIs (ALS 4) implemented during the study period, was implemented. We found that all other restrictive commbinations reduced the net reproduction number relative to no NPIs, but only ALS-4 was found to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the true incidence for a period of time. During the study period, estimated true incidence (182,534) was over four times the number of reported RT-PCR confirmed cases (41,619). Our findings suggest that stringent public health measures can contain Omicron variant spread in highly a vaccinated populations, an outcome that has been observed in only a few jurisdictions. Our approach illustrates how quantities that inform future pandemic preparedness can be estimated even when testing eligibility is restricted and changing.
