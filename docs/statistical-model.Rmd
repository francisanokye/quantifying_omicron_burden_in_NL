We assume that the transmission rate, $\beta$, is a smooth function of time that can be represented as.
$$
\beta(t) = \exp\left(b_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{N_B} b_iB_i(t-t_s)\right)
$$
where $t$ is the time measured in days, $t_s$ is the start time, $b_0$ is the log of the baseline transmission rate, the $B_i(\cdot)$ are $N_B$ natural splines (TODO: Steve give a more precise definition), and the $b_i$, $i = 1, ..., N_B$, are parameters to be estimated that determine the shape of the time-variation function. The prior distribution of this function is determined by a prior the following priors.

$$
\log(b_0) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\log\left(\frac{1}{4}\right), 1\right)
$$
$$
\log(b_i) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, 1\right)
$$

We also place priors on dynamical parameters ... TODO
